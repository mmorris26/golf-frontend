# Golfy

## Motivation
This is the final project of my Software Engineering Immersive course from General Assembly. 
The aim of the project is to combine all of the knowledge we have learnt up to this point into one full-stack project. For this project we had a lot of freedom to build whatever we wanted as long as it satisfied a few high-level requirements. 

## Requirements
- Build a full stack web application.
- In the backend, have at least two models.
- Implement user authentication.
- Have full CRUD on at least one model.
- Use one of the following tech stacks;
    - Full stack Rails
    - Rails API backend and React Frontend (not allowed to use `rails scaffold`)
    - Express API backend and react Frontend
- Fully deployed application.

## Summary 
For this project I decided to build a Rails backend and a React frontend. I chose Rails in the backend due to the amount of Gems of built-in functionality of it. For example, in order to implement full authentication using the MERN stack it took a large amount of work and debugging. With rails I used the devise and devise-jwt gems to write a large amount of the functionality for me. I chose to use a React frontend to practice my React skills. Choosing two different languages for front and back end did make deployment more challenging but my aim of this project was to learn as much as I could, so by having them different a learnt a lot more.

For the application itself I decided to build a fully responsive golf tracking website where a user can input what course they played on, what they scored, who they played with, what they scored and finally be able to see a summary of their own results.
